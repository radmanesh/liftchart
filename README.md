**liftchart** is an R package that provides tools for calculating and plotting cumulative gain and lift charts, which are essential for evaluating the performance of predictive classification models. These charts help visualize the effectiveness of a model by showing how well it distinguishes between classes across different segments of data.

## Examples

### Using Synthetic Data

```R
# Generate synthetic data
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  actual = rbinom(1000, 1, 0.3),              # Actual binary outcomes
  predicted = runif(1000, min = 0, max = 1)   # Predicted probabilities
)

# Calculate lift chart data
lift_data <- lift_chart_data(data, actual = "actual", predicted = "predicted", groups = 10)

# Print the lift chart data
print(lift_data)

# Plot cumulative gains chart
plot_cumulative_gain(lift_data)
```
